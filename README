PLATFORM SUPPORT LAYER FOR SILICON INFUSION ZALTYS PRODUCTS
===========================================================

Recipes to provide a baseline Linux environment across all Zaltys
software platforms.

Use this layer in conjunction with a board-support layer to build a
Linux image for a Zaltys product (e.g. meta-zaltys-zmp003 for the
Zaltys ZMP003 CPU board).

BUILD SETUP
-----------

Add this layer to your YOCTO build configuration setup,
<build-dir>/conf/bblayers.conf, with:-

  BBLAYERS += " <layer-dir>/meta-zaltys-platform "

where <layer-dir> is the fully qualified path to the directory which
contains this layer definition.

You may also want to set some standard YOCTO configuration variables
in your local configuration file, <build-dir>/conf/local.conf, such
as:-

  IMAGE_ROOTFS_EXTRA_SPACE = "1048576"

to add an extra 1GB of free space to the SDCARD image that will be
built.

To build an image issue the command:-

  $ bitbake zaltys-platform-image
